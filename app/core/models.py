    Generally speaking, it’s easiest to refer to the user model with the
    "AUTH_USER_MODEL" setting in code that’s executed at import time, however,
    it’s also possible to call "get_user_model()" while Django is importing
    models, so you could use "models.ForeignKey(get_user_model(), ...)".
    As the models are executed at import time, it's somehow easier (or maybe
    even faster) to use AUTH_USER_MODEL notation than using
    models.ForeignKey(get_user_model(), ...). But both of them works.
